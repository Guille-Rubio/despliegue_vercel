# despliegue_vercel con puppeteer
Deploy of a Node.js backend with Express in Vercel with Puppeteer

Please bear in mind that serverless functions in Vercel have a limit of 50mb, therefore we will need to use a lighter version of Puppeteer and Chromium, namely `puppeteer-core`and `chrome-aws-lambda`.
